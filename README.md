# Game night scoreboard

A simple SPA application for tracking your game nights with your friends

## About

on the front page you can see what games you are playing. You can go to the detail page or see your scoreboard.
You can also add new games so you keep track of what is being played

In the scoreboard section you can track the players, add or remove players and track how many games they played and how many wins they have.

## future ideas

add view and edit game details, for some specific info
add state saving using local storage so you can track your games and scores without losing your data
add API call for searching board games or adding them to your list much easier
add notes to the scoreboard so you can write down maybe something interesting that happened during your play time with friends
